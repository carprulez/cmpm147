				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is a randomizer where the tiles display random letters to make the map look like a crossword.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used randomness to generate the letters on top of each tile and then used modulo to get the next letter in the alphabet when you click the tile .</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This process was fun and pretty easy. Getting the tiles to be black and white was easy. The trickiest part was getting the randomized letters, but with the help of ChatGPT I was able to. I really enjoy playing crosswords so I thought that this was a fun task to try and accomplish.</p>
