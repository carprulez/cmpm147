				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is a generator for an infinite table with food for you to eat.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used the p5 drawing tools and lists with randomness to provide you with infinite food.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was a fun task because I like the idea of infinite free food. I had a good time trying to figure out how to get the plates to appear above the tile. I took inspiration from the example game "You will never be king" in order to draw the plates. I am really proud of the always refilling plates with fruits on them as well.</p>
